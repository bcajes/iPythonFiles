    "        - polarization applications: 3D movies to the study of honey navigation\n",
    "        - made easier by thinking of light as a wave (worth pointing out in the beginning, that although we can measure the ability of a photoreceptor to be activated by a certain *quanta* of light (# of photons), its wave nature makes this concept easier to understand) \n",
    "- **Kinds of Polarization**\n",
    "    1. light can be thought of as a wave that propagates through space\n",
    "    2 **IMAGINE**: a perfectly monochromatic, perfectly collimated (made accurately parallel) beam of light in a vacuum (optical platonic ideals)\n",
    "    3. ELECTRIC FIELD METER (in path of this beam) READS: *the magnitude of the local electric field changes very rapidly in a sinusoidal fashion*\n",
    "    4. **What about the direction of the field?**\n",
    "        - **unlike air pressure in a sound wave, electric fields are vectors and thus have both magnitudes and direction**\n",
    "    5. direction is **always perpendicular to the firection of the propagation of the light beam and is called \"THE E-VECTOR\"** (so called since it is describing matter's interaction with the electric field)\n",
    "        - this is a convention, such that we can measure an angle to describe its direction relative to the vertical, even though we could also do the opposite.\n",
    "    6. magnetic field is usually (but not always) perpendicular to and in phase with the electric field $\\implies$ knowing the e-vector tells you the magnetic field.\n",
    "    7. EVECTOR = sum of two e-vectors: horizontal and vertical e-vector\n",
    "    8. the horizontal and vertical components are completely described by three things: frequency, amplitude and phase.\n",
    "        - if we assume monochromatic, we can ignore frequency (so we can set the frequency to 1).\n",
    "        - we only really care about the **phase difference** (so we can set the horizontal component to zero).\n",
    "        - So the horizontal and vertical components measured by our meter:\n",

    "        1. polarized skylight\n",
    "            - usually relate to some form of navigation or orientation\n",
    "            - Karl von Frish (1967) the Dance Language and Orientation of Bees\n",

    "                - you will travel in circles swimming under an open sky or hiking in a featureless terrain\n",

    "                    - PATHS ARE STRAIGHT WHEN THE MOON WAS OUT AND NEARLY RANDOM WHEN THE MOON WAS GONE\n",

    "                    - polarization comes from scattered moonlight rather than scatter sunlight\n",

    "        2. polarized reflections\n",
    "            - nature is filled with shiny surfaces (leaves, water, iridescent surfaces of animals)\n",

    "            - **WATER FINDING**\n",

    "                - either increasing visual range or breaking the camouflage of certain animals\n",
    "                - early engineers approached a problem (that underwater visual range is usually orders of magnitude less than it is on land) by using circularly polarized light, which reflection from extended surfaces (which you want to see) interacts differently than scattering from suspended particles (which get in the way)\n",
    "                - by illuminating subjects with circularly polarized light of one-handedness and viewing through a filter of the other handedness, they were able to get clearer underwater images.\n",
